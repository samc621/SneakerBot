# UI/UX

After completeting steps above....

(UI will only work on port 8080 as of now!!! Make sure your port in .env.local file is set to port 8080 otherwise this will not work)

1. `$ cd Sneakekerbot/client` 

2. `$ npm i`
 
3. `$ npm start `

loads full UI to add addresses, proxies, and tasks to API

Still underdevelopment, but majority is functional and will work!
